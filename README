   USAGE
 
   To configure username and password for the server instance,
   add:

   "username:password\n" to config/passwd for each user.
 
   On the server run dropsyd.go with Go-lang compiler/interpreter and
   in the directory you wish filesystem mirroring to occur.
  
   The client is executed as below:
 
   $ dropsy username@host:/path/to/directory 
 
   e.g.
   
   $ dropsy dave@trouserlump.com:/home/dave/files

   The client will duplicate and update the local directory layout and
   contents to the remote computer running the server.
